      Rebilly will select the appropriate payment gateway account for the transaction based on 
      the properties of the transaction and the gateway-account-requested event rules configurations.
      If you wish to prevent Rebilly from making the gateway account selection, you may supply a
      gateway account id here, and it will be used instead.  Only use this field if you
      intend to override the settings.
